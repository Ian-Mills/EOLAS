# EOLAS

EOLAS: E-Learning Of Language Augmented Services is an
innovative project focused on teaching the Irish language through
an XR-enhanced platform. . With EOLAS, which in Gaeilge (Irish)
means knowledge we will leveraging a Large Language Model
(LLM) trained on Irish language corpuses, EOLAS functions as an
educational chatbot that interacts with learners via an Augmented
Reality (AR) interface. The chatbot provides immersive
conversational practice and performs object recognition to teach
Irish vocabulary for real-world objects. By combining XR
technology with advanced AI, EOLAS creates a dynamic and
interactive language learning environment, making Irish language
education more engaging and effective for learners of all levels.
